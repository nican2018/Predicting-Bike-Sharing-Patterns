# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns
Udacity AI nano program

This a Deep Learning project which predicts Bike Sharing Patterns.  

## Explanation
The Neural network was built from "scratch", using only NumPy to assist. 
The goal of this project is to understand what happens behind the neural network
before diving deeper into other tools like PyTorch.
